## Scanning
We run nmap on all ports with scripts and software versions.

## Enumeration
We access the web resource on port 80, but find nothing relevant.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/3.png)

We access the web resource on port 443, check the code, but find nothing interesting either.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/4.png)

We launch the **whatweb** tool and list the domain "*office.paper*".

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/5.png)

We put it in the file "*/etc/hosts*" and find a new site with **WordPress version 5.2.3**:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/6.png)

We list a possible **WordPress** user "*Prisionmike*":

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/7.png)

But it seems that the user is not valid:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/8.png)

If we look at the articles, they mention users and give clues as to what is happening on the site. Apparently, they are asking to delete a post that is in drafts, as it thinks it is not safe to store them there.

## Exploitation
It can be seen that this version of **WordPress** is vulnerable and it would be possible to read private posts.

##### Exploit: [WordPress Core < 5.2.3 - Viewing Unauthenticated/Password/Private Posts - Multiple webapps Exploit (exploit-db.com)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47690)

Using the exploit, we see some posts that we did not know, for example, this one already mentions that there are users leaving posts in drafts with relevant information.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/11.png)

We use the exploit in descending order, we see a secret registration link for new employees at "*chat.office.paper*...."

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/12.png)

We access the site and find an application called "**rocket.chat**":

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/13.png)

If we look for exploits, we find two interesting ones, a NoSQL and an RCE:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/14.png)

I tried to exploit some of the vulnerabilities, but it seems that they did not apply to the deployed version. So I registered an account and logged into the site for further enumeration.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/15.png)

Apparently, there is a bot (*recyblops*) with which you can execute commands, by testing I managed to enumerate the user "*dwight*" when trying to load a file "*test.txt*" from his directory.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/16.png)

Continuing with the tests, I managed to run a kind of system "**ls***", enumerating the file "*portfolio.txt*".

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/17.png)

It seems that the bot is vulnerable to Path Traversal, we managed to read the "*/etc/passwd*" file:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/18.png)

It seems to be well sanitized and does not allow to execute commands, but you can enumerate files:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/19.png)

We read files from the bot, we see the content of the script and that it calls the file "*start_bot.sh*".

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/20.png)

##### Contents of the file "start_bot.sh":

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/21.png)

We check the "*.env*" file and find the **rocket.chat** credentials:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/22.png)

If we try to access through the browser, we see that the site does not allow the Bots to make connections via the web.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/23.png)

Let's remember that we knew which users are in the system, so we test the "*dwight*" one, get **SSH** access and read the "*user.txt*" flag.

## Privilege Escalation
We launched the "**linpeas**" tool to perform a preliminary system reconnaissance and found that the machine is vulnerable to *Polkit*.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Paper/25.png)

##### Exploit: [GitHub - Almorabea/Polkit-exploit: Privilege escalation with polkit - CVE-2021-3560](https://github.com/Almorabea/Polkit-exploit)

We download the exploit on the victim machine, run it with **Python3** and manage to escalate privileges to root.
