## Scanning
We launch **nmap** with scripts and software versions.

## Enumeration
We access the web service, we only see that it is in test mode.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/3.png)

We access the file *"robots.txt"* and list the directory *"/webmasters/"*.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/4.png)

We run the **dirsearch** tool with some known extensions and a common dictionary in the directory listed above.

We list some interesting directories.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/5.png)

We listed an administration panel in the "/webmasters/admin/" directory, but it does not work.

We continue with **dirsearch** and start searching for files by known extensions in the directories listed above. 

We list a *backups.zip* file:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/7.png)

We see that the file has a password to decompress, we use **zip2john** and crack the hash with the **rockyou** dictionary.

We use the password and read the file, it gives us the username of the **FTP** service.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/8.png)

We performed brute force with the enumerated user, the **rockyou** dictionary and the **Hydra** tool. We managed to find the password of the **FTP** service.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/9.png)

We use the **FTP** service credentials, list several folders and two interesting files *"id_rsa"* and *"not.txt"*.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/10.png)

#### Content of both files:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/11.png)

## Exploitation
We use the **ssh2john** tool, crack the hash with john and the wordlist **rockyou** to get the password.

We use the credentials in the **SSH** service to gain access to the machine.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/12.png)

We see that we have a restricted bash, so we reopen the ssh session with *"bash --noprofile"* and export a couple of environment variables so we can have an interactive shell.

I search the internet for the words "*Mnemonic crypto*", find this tool on this **[github](https://github.com/MustafaTanguner/Mnemonic)**, download the tool and try the numerical file.

At the moment there is nothing we can do, as we need a photograph.

If we try to list the directories and files, we are able to list a couple of files of the user "Condor", there we see two files with the title in base64.

#### A file is the flag of user.txt

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/15.png)

#### Content 2nd file

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/16.png)

We go back to the tool, specify the photo and the path to the text file, we will get the password of the user "*condor*".

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/17.png)

## Privilege Escalation
We authenticate as the user "*condor*" and we see that we are able to run a python script with **SUDO**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/18.png)

#### Python script in execution

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/19.png)

We see that "**date**" is executed without mentioning the absolute path, this would allow us to replace it and modify the path to execute our malicious binary and gain access.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/20.png)

But it does not work! So we continue reviewing the code, we see something suspicious, the function with *code 0* allows you to write, so we would still be able to execute commands like root....

#### Proof of concept

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m3n0sd0n4ld/m3n0sd0n4ld.github.io/main/_posts/Mnemonic/22.png)

Well, easy, we call the bash binary with the flag *"-p"* and we will get a shell as root.
